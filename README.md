# Online Bookstore Application

## Project Overview

This project aims to deliver a fully-functional online bookstore application.
The app allows users to browse, manage shopping carts, and place orders,
while admins can manage books, categories, and order statuses.
The application is developed using Java and Spring Boot and follows a domain-driven design.
Below are the core domain models used in the app.

- **Role**: Represents the user's role in the system (e.g., admin, user).
- **Book**: Represents a book available for purchase in the store.
- **Category**: Represents a category that books can belong to.
- **ShoppingCart**: Represents a user's shopping cart.
- **CartItem**: Represents an item in the user's shopping cart.
- **Order**: Represents an order placed by a user.
- **OrderItem**: Represents an item within a userâ€™s order.
